# Simple Card Game Prototype

This is a simple prototype of a card game created using Unity. The project was developed as part of a technical test, focusing on basic card mechanics including deck creation, hand management, and card placement on a table.

## Features

- **Deck Creation (Editor-time):**
  - The deck of cards can be created and configured directly in the Unity Editor. This includes assigning card names, powers, and the deck size.

- **Hand Management:**
  - The hand is populated with a predefined number of cards at the start of the game. Cards are dealt randomly from the deck, ensuring variety in gameplay.

- **Card Placement on the Table:**
  - Cards can be dragged and placed on a designated area (table) in the game. They can be placed at the end, with logic implemented to maintain order based on card power.

- **Tooltips:**
  - Tooltips provide additional information for each card in the Unity Inspector, aiding in understanding the role of each variable.
